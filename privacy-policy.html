    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 9, 2024<br>
      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 9, 2024
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Simple Summary:</strong> Invoicer is a local application that runs in your browser. We don't collect, store, or share your data. When you connect your Gmail, we only request permission to send emails on your behalf. All your invoice data stays on your computer.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Invoicer ("we," "our," or "the Application"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our invoice generation application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invoicer is a client-side web application that helps you create and send professional invoices. The application runs entirely in your web browser and does not transmit your data to any external servers except as explicitly described below.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>When using Invoicer, you may enter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your business name and email address</li>
      <li>Client names and email addresses</li>
      <li>Invoice details (numbers, dates, amounts, descriptions)</li>
      <li>Payment information and notes</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> All this information is stored locally in your web browser only. We do not transmit, store, or access this data on any server.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Gmail API Access</h3>
    <p>When you choose to connect your Gmail account to send invoices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What we access:</strong> Your email address (for authentication purposes only)</li>
      <li><strong>What we can do:</strong> Send emails on your behalf with PDF invoice attachments</li>
      <li><strong>What we CANNOT do:</strong> Read your existing emails, access your contacts, or modify your Gmail settings</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Gmail Permissions:</strong> We only request the <code>gmail.send</code> scope, which allows the application to send emails. We DO NOT request permission to read your emails or access any other Gmail data.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 Local Data Processing</h3>
    <p>All invoice data you enter is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate invoice previews in your browser</li>
      <li>Create PDF documents locally on your device</li>
      <li>Pre-fill email messages when sending invoices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Gmail Integration</h3>
    <p>When you authorize Gmail access, we use it only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate your Google account</li>
      <li>Send invoice emails with PDF attachments to your clients</li>
      <li>Display your connected email address in the application</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Local Storage Only</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>All your data stays on your device.</strong> Invoicer does not have backend servers or databases. Your invoice information is never uploaded, transmitted, or stored on any external servers.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 OAuth Tokens</h3>
    <p>
      When you connect Gmail, Google provides a temporary access token that expires after 1 hour. This token is stored temporarily in your browser's memory and is automatically deleted when you close the application.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 No Cloud Backup</h3>
    <p>
      We do not provide cloud backup or synchronization features. If you clear your browser data or use a different device, your invoice information will not be available.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Google OAuth & Gmail API</h3>
    <p>
      When you connect your Gmail account, you interact directly with Google's authentication and email services. Google's use of your information is governed by their privacy policy:
      <br><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 CDN Services</h3>
    <p>
      The application loads certain libraries (html2pdf.js, Google APIs) from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). These services may log basic connection information like your IP address and browser type, but they do not receive any of your invoice data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with anyone.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>Your information is never shared with third parties except:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gmail Recipients:</strong> When you choose to send an invoice, the email and PDF are sent to the recipient you specify</li>
      <li><strong>Google:</strong> Your email address is shared with Google for authentication purposes only</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Not applicable as we don't store your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

    <h3>7.1 Gmail Access Control</h3>
    <p>You can revoke Invoicer's access to your Gmail at any time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Permissions</a></li>
      <li>Find "Invoicer" in the list</li>
      <li>Click "Remove Access"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.2 Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally in your browser:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear your browser cache/data to delete all invoice information</li>
      <li>Uninstall or stop using the application at any time</li>
      <li>There is no data stored on our servers to delete</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Invoicer is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page indicates when the policy was last revised. Continued use of the application after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Open Source and Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Invoicer is a simple, transparent application. You can review the source code directly by viewing the HTML file. We believe in full transparency about how your data is handled.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Compliance</h2>
    
    <h3>11.1 Google API Services User Data Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Invoicer's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>11.2 Data Minimization</h3>
    <p>
      We request the minimum permissions necessary (only <code>gmail.send</code>) and do not access any data beyond what is required to send invoice emails.
    </p>
